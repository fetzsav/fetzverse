## The Misuse of Blogs
Having a personal blog has always been nonessenial in my mind. In fact, I've never really had any interest in reading blogs. Sure, I've *read* blog posts... but I've never read a ceratin particular blog for any good reason. It wasn't until recently I began to realize how often I **do** use blogs just from even simple Google searches asking *"how to thaw fish"*. As a junior developer, content creators, (more specificially: bloggers), are one of the key resources for learning technical information on subjects such as coding libraries, 3D graphic techniques, social media engagement tactics, or various things of our new-fashioned ecosystem. Without personal bloggers and content creators, the process of learning these subjects would be many times more difficult. As I said, reading blogs was never part of my regular routine. Sure, I may find a blog post via. a Google search... but my chances of ever viewing that blog again are next to zero. At least, that's how I used to be. Throughout my journey of programming, I owe much of my knowledge to blogs written by individuals with no formal relation to the subject at hand. Don't get me wrong... reading the documentation to learn new languages and libraries is always the best and most sure way to learn a subject to it's fullest. Yet, you can fast track many aspects of the process via. reading other user's experiences and guides on their personal blogs, cutting out possibly hours of trial and error. This effect is probably seen more profusely in a beginner developer versus a more experienced one.

Never the less, realizing all of this, I never returned my attention to these blogs I was robbing knowledge from. Honestly, I never gave it a second thought or considered the writer behind the posts and guides I was reading online.
If you asked me, "Do you think blogging is thriving in 2022?" I would most definitely say "No". In my mind, social media had destroyed people's interests in small blogs, online forums, and things of the like. Yet, here I was... reading blog posts. Daily. There was a key difference here though. I wasn't reading **the blogs**... only **the posts**. I failed to realize the lucrative model around blogging. I failed to realize that not only is blogging "still a thing", but blogging is thriving more than ever before.
The real question here is, who was getting the short end of the stick in this deal... me, or the blog? I would now argue that these blogs never needed me. These blogs were doing great before I came along. One more hit on their website... one more person their blog post reaches... this is nothing compared to the hits they are already receiving. It's me, the reader, who lost the oppurtunity to bookmark the blog. 
Once I began realizing this, I would search through my browser history on my devices, looking for any posts or articles I've refernced from blogs, trying to find them again and save them. Something tells me I'm not the only person who has experienced this epiphany. 
//However, this is quite the daunting task and I have 'lost' blogs that could have probably been immensiely valuable for me.

## Forget the Blogger




## Blogging and Social Media 
At this point, my mindset towards blogging has changed. I've always *wanted* certain things when it comes to how I viewed blogging and social media. 
1. I *wanted* to have my own blog
2. I *wanted* to find cool blogs to read
3. I *wanted* to find like-minded individuals

I do not think I am the only person with these very basic *wants*. A matter of fact, I will make a wild assumption by saying I think **many** people want these things, and that they actively agree that yes... these things do *sound nice*. Personally, I thought this was out of reach in the modern age of social media.




Collaborating with people of similar interests and discussing topics of similar concepts online is the core concept of social media.
