## The Misuse of Blogs
Having a personal blog has always been nonessenial in my mind. In fact, I've never really had any interest in reading blogs. Sure, I've *read* blog posts... but I've never read a ceratin particular blog for any good reason. It wasn't until recently I began to realize how often I **do** use blogs just from even simple Google searches asking *"how to thaw fish"*. As a junior developer... content creators, (more specificially: bloggers), are one of the key resources for learning technical information on subjects such as coding libraries, 3D graphic techniques, social media engagement tactics, or various things of our new-fashioned  technology-centric ecosystem. Without personal bloggers and content creators, the process of learning these subjects would be many times more difficult. As I said, reading blogs was never part of my regular routine. Sure, I may find a blog post via. a Google search... but my chances of ever viewing that blog again are next to zero. Yet, throughout my journey of programming, I owe much of my knowledge to blogs written by individuals with no formal relation or obligation to the subject at hand. Don't get me wrong... reading the documentation to learn new languages and libraries is always the best and most sure way to learn a subject to it's fullest. Yet, you can fast track many aspects of the process via. reading other user's experiences and guides on their personal blogs - cutting out possibly hours of trial and error. This effect is probably seen more profusely in a beginner developer versus a more experienced one. Never the less, realizing all of this, I never returned my attention to these blogs I was robbing knowledge from. Honestly, I never gave it a second thought or considered the writer behind the posts and guides I was reading online. I wasn't reading **the blogs**... only **the posts**. I failed to realize the lucrative model around blogging. I failed to realize that not only is blogging "still a thing", but blogging is thriving more than ever before.
The real question here is, who was getting the short end of the stick in this deal... me, or the blogs? I would now argue that these blogs never needed me. These blogs were doing great before I came along. One more hit on their website... one more person their blog post reaches... this is nothing compared to the hits they are already receiving. It's me, the reader, who **lost the oppurtunity to bookmark the blog**. 

## Blogging and Social Media
If you asked me, "Do you think blogging is thriving in 2022?" I would most definitely say "No". In my mind, social media had destroyed people's interests in small blogs, online forums, and things of the like. However, I was wrong. In the recent years, social media has attempted to not only be a social interaction platform, but a content platform as well. In fact, I have found local businesses who are setup on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, yet they do not even have a website homepage. Even worse... people will look at this scenario and claim "Social media is all you need these days. Everything is on social media". This was also my mindset. This is the reason people do not appreciate blogs.
Any content on social media is extremely short lived. Trending topics on Twitter can change within a matter of hours, leaving your informative *NPM tips* thread in the dust forever.

## Plans for This Blog
At this point, my mindset towards blogging has changed. I've always *wanted* certain things when it comes to how I viewed blogging and social media. 
1. I *wanted* to have my own blog
2. I *wanted* to find cool blogs to read
3. I *wanted* to find like-minded individuals

I do not think I am the only person with these very basic *wants*. A matter of fact, I will make a wild assumption by saying I think **many** people want these things, and that they actively agree that yes... these things do *sound nice*. At least for me, the idea of having a blog has always been attractive. I've always wanted a place to collect my thoughts and share them with the world. I've always wanted a place to share things I have learned and to help people to understand them. Creating a blog has always been one of those things "I'll get around to". Blog posts come to my mind that I need to write, but I do not have a blog to put them on. Instead, my ideas and thoughts are poured into the wasteland that we call social media. 




Collaborating with people of similar interests and discussing topics of similar concepts online is the core concept of social media.
