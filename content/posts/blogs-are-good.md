## Blogs are Undervalued
Having a personal blog has always been nonessential in my mind. In fact, I've never really had any interest in reading blogs at all. Sure, I've *read* blog posts... but I've never read a certain particular blog for any good reason. It wasn't until recently I began to realize how often I **do** use blogs just from even simple Google searches asking *"how to thaw fish?"* I became aware that the internet would be an incredibly boring place without blogs. As a junior developer... content creators, (more specifically: bloggers), are one of the key resources for learning technical information on subjects such as coding libraries, 3D graphic techniques, social media engagement tactics, or various things of our new-fashioned  technology-centric ecosystem. Without personal bloggers and content creators, the process of learning these subjects would be many times more difficult. As I mentioned... reading blogs was never part of my regular routine. Sure, I may find a blog post via. a Google search, but my chances of ever viewing that blog again are next to zero. Yet, throughout my journey of programming, I owe much of my knowledge to blogs written by individuals with no formal relation or obligation to the subject at hand. Don't get me wrong, reading an official documentation to learn new languages and libraries is always the best and most sure way to truely learn a subject. Yet, you can fast track many aspects of the process via. reading other user's experiences and guides on their personal blogs - cutting out possibly hours of trial and error. Reading a third party guide from another user's blog could even mean the difference between being able to complete the task at hand or not for many developers. This effect is probably seen more profusely in a beginner developer versus a more experienced one. Never the less, realizing all of this, at no time did I return my attention to these blogs I was robbing knowledge from. Honestly, I never gave it a second thought or considered the writer behind the posts and guides I was reading online. I wasn't reading **the blogs**... only **the posts**. I failed to realize the lucrative model around blogging. I failed to realize that not only is blogging "still a thing", but blogging is thriving more than ever before.
The real question here is, who was getting the short end of the stick in this deal... me, or the blogs? I would now argue that these blogs never needed me. These blogs were doing great before I came along. One more hit on their website... one more person their blog post reaches... this is nothing compared to the hits they are already receiving. It's me, the reader, who **lost the opportunity to bookmark the blog**. 

## Blogging and Social Media
If you asked me, "Do you think blogging is thriving in 2022?" I would most definitely say "No". In my mind, social media had destroyed people's interests in small blogs, online forums, and things of the like. However, I was wrong. In the recent years, social media has attempted to not only suffice as a social interaction platform, but a content platform as well. The only problem with this is any content on social media is extremely short lived. Trending topics on Twitter can change within a matter of hours, leaving your informative *NPM tips* thread in the dust forever. This leaves social media services impractical as any real medium for holding content for long periods of time. Yet, many people don't see it this way. In fact, there are local businesses in my city who have profiles on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, yet they do not even have a website homepage. Even worse... people will look at this scenario and claim "Social media is all you need these days. Everything is on social media"... which is a mindset I am guilty of in the past. This false narrative is why the blogging scene is mistakenly undervalued by many individuals.

At the time of writing this article, my mindset towards blogging has changed. I've always *wanted* certain things when it comes to how I viewed blogging and social media.
1. I *wanted* to have my own blog
2. I *wanted* to find cool blogs to read
3. I *wanted* to find like-minded individuals

I do not think I am the only persontrueou *want*, I urge you to actually consider this possibility and make it a reality, especially if you are *(wasting time)* on  social media. The best part about having a blog that you do not have to quit using social media. I expect that having a blog will not only increase my social media engagement and statistics, but also revamp the way I use the apps in a more productive manner.

## Plans for This Blog
Thankfully, I have finally mustered up enough strength to create **my own blog**. There is a lot more that goes into a blog than setting it up and creating the first post though. (Which has already proven it's challenges). Firstly, I feel slightly more fulfillment every day thanks to this wonderful blog of mine. There is a new sense of ownership in the online world that is incomparable to any Twitter or Instagram profile. This was the largest step in the journey of having my own blog, which leaves me the opportunity to write about anything I want at anytime I want. There are times when I have felt creatively inclined to write content or tutorials, but have not had the medium to do so. Problem solved.

With that in mind, I am satisfied with that current state for now as to not feel obligated to spend all of my time writing. I do not expect to be blogging full-time anytime soon, as I am working on many projects simultaneously, including the design for this site. However, I hope to be writing fairly often, especially about topics related to my current projects. Regardless, my blog posts will cover many topics, most (if not all) of them will be technology oriented. Since this is my first post, I'll give you a list of things I've been interested in recently to give you an idea of what I may decide to write about.

### Things to Expect from my Blog

    - Javascript/React
    - Building API's & user authentication
    - SQL databases
    - GoLang
    - Ethereum blockchain development
- Homelab / Server management
