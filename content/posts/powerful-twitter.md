title: Fuck the Algorithm - Twitter's API is Power

Twitter and it's board of directors has recently been a topic of controversal discussion. With Elon Musk's offer to buy the platform being accepted, it has left many Twitter users waiting to (sometimes reluctantly) see some big changes on the platform. Outside of this recent debocle, Twitter has undergone some other major development changes. More specifically, I am referring to the new Twitter API... Twitter API V2. Granted, much of the core functionality and possibilites from the V1 API are the same in the V2 API. However, endpoint URLs have been changed, responses are slightly better. Request parameters are done a little differently as well, all in all, hopefully making using the API easier, and getting the results you were looking for from requests more reliable.
The Twitter API intrigued me... mainly because of the amount of automated accounts and actions I see on the platform. Well, that... also paired with my beleif of Twitter being the online equilvilant of your local public square... except... for the whole world.



### Social Media's Tracking Habits
When participating on any social media platform we all know that our data is being used for tracking and marketing. This is how the platforms make money. Every social media platform has the ability to learn what a user's favorite interests are and provide them with related content. This is the core functionality of these platforms... it is what we expect them to do. So, it isn't a surprise to any of us that Twitter is doing the same. None of us care, we still use the platform, it's part of our agreement. Twitter provides the fun and we provide the marketable data. 
Yet, I've noticed an aditional piece to the puzzle since working with the Twitter API. More specifically, with the /search/ endpoint. I couldn't tell you if other platforms have similar endpoints or not... but I was surprised to see just how powerful this one endpoint can be, and it leaves me wondering, do users of Twitter know about the power behind this endpoint?

### What is The /search/ Endpoint
If you are unfamiliar with using 3rd party APIs, then you probably don't really know what I am talking about yet. Don't worry, it's simple. When you are using any social media platform, you are typically given some sort of search bar or search option. You know... the Facebook search bar... or searching for a profile on Instagram. Yes, we are talking about normal user things here. You can use the search bar to search for other user's profiles, posts, or anything else on the social media's website. Similarialy, the /search/ endpoint allows developers to use the Twitter search box without visiting the Twitter website or app. It also provides quite the multitude of filters and search query options to fine tune your search even farther. More specifically... it searches for Tweets... not profiles or groups or anything like that. 
So, **the /search/ endpoint is an advanced and fine tuned method to search for Tweets throughout the entirety of Twitter**


### Snoopidy Snoop, DAWG
You may still not see the power behind this endpoint yet, but let me put some things into perspective for you. Imagine if your whole city was being audio recorded 24/7. Every table in every restaraunt has a microphone. Every inch of sidewalk. Everywhere. There's no escaping the microphones. All conversations are recorded and saved, and the city municipals can go back and listen to any conversation from any day that happened in their city. This sounds crazy and unfeasible, right? This sort of access would be too much to even be useful. Most, if not all conversations would be trivial, and not have any real value to the person (or persons) eavsdropping. (Which would be some sort of political power or overruling authority, right? Making sure we are on the same page here). There is something I forgot to mention about these recording devices though. Not only do they record your voice, but they also transcribe what you say into a database. So, if you were talking about 'cats', then the big-bad-city can search and listen to only 'cat' conversations that happened in their city that day. Woah, now, the city muncipals know their population's feelings towards cats by eavesdropping onto what they have to say about cats! Or, maybe they search for conversations that include the words 'hate', 'horrible', or 'stupid' along with the word "Johnny Depp". With this set of converstions from the city, they are able to get an idea of how many people dislike Johnny Depp. 
You're now probably thinking, "Well, great. So what? Who cares?". Well, let me add one more layer into the hypothetical for you. Imagine all these crazy things from before with the microphones and the whole city being recorded. Now, I want you to imagine something even more crazy. What if the recording devices could somehow magically detect the true identity of the person speaking? So then, the city municpals know not only **WHAT** was said, but also **WHO** said it! Honestly, this is really hard to imagine. It's a little too much of a stretch. Well, good thing you don't need to imagine that. It already exists. **It's called Twitter.**
